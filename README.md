# My approach

My main idea was to help a customer make a more educated guess about which skip size to choose.I tried to use all the information that i got from the backend as possible.
Also i believe that showing which skip size is the most popular would help the customer choose an option with more confidence.
There should also be a short text guide in how to choose the correct size for your needs
There should also be some more filters based on price or size of the skip (The filters i use currently look bad and need a lot of improvement but i believe you will understand my idea)
I removed the usage of images as i saw no use for it because all the images are the same and offer no information to the user.
The top navigation i believe is great on the main website but i simply tried something a little more different
The feature of selecting the card would remain the same as on the main web page but honestly i forgot to add it and remembered it just before i needed to go on a 5 hours trip but i would keep it the same as on original page

# Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling and responsive design.
- **DaisyUI** for ready-made components, streamlining development.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainable code.

This is a simple project, so I avoided complex state management, keeping the tech stack light and efficient.

# What I Would Do With More Time

With more time, I would focus on:
- **Design**: Improve visual aspects like colors, typography, and spacing.
- **Responsiveness**: Optimize the layout for better adaptability on all devices.
- **Features**: Add more filters or an interactive skip size estimator.

Given the two-hour time constraint, this is a foundational implementation, and I would refine it further with more resources.
